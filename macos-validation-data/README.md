# MacOS Validation Data Generator

Given valid Mac hardware configuration, this command line application will generate signed iMessage + FaceTime 
validation data using a specific release version of the OpenBubbles `flutter_rust_bridge` shared library.

This is required for building OpenBubbles with full capabilities, because this portion of the application remains closed
source.
